**table 1**: In the ablation experiments, we additionally provide p-values calculated via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric, paired comparisons).
Except for w/o Aug. and w/o MIL (p ≥ 0.05), all other ablations exhibited statistically significant differences at a significance level of α = 0.05.
Nevertheless, we believe that experiments with more datasets can demonstrate the importance of all modules.
